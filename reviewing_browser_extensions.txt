### Suspicious Extension Example

1. **Extension: Video Downloader Pro**
   - **Description**: Download videos from any site directly to your computer.
   - **Permissions**:
     - Read and change all your data on all websites you visit
     - Access clipboard data

   **Reason for Removal**:
   - **Permissions are too broad**: The extension doesnâ€™t need access to all websites or clipboard data for downloading videos. This is a **suspicious behavior**.
   - **Action Taken**: Removed the extension immediately to prevent potential data leakage.

---

### Outcome:
- All extensions reviewed, suspicious ones removed.
- Browser performance improved after removal of suspicious extensions.
- No suspicious behavior observed after review.

Note:

 **How can browser extensions pose security risks?**

 **What permissions should raise suspicion?**  
   - "Read and change all your data on websites you visit"
   - "Access to clipboard data"
